    JavaScript: Implemented for interactivity and to add dynamic elements to the page.

Project Structure:

    index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the tribute page.
    styles.css: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the page.
    script.js: The JavaScript file responsible for adding interactivity and dynamic elements to the tribute page.

Contributions:
I developed this tribute page as a part of the Oasis Infobyte Level 2 Task 2. It was an opportunity for me to apply my front-end development skills and create a visually appealing and informative tribute page for a cricketing legend. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and learning more about MS Dhoni's inspiring journey.

Feel free to explore the tribute page and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. I'm open to collaboration and further enhancing this project in the future.
